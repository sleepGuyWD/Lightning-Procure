Before I learned to code, I wanted to create a program that could calculate inventory levels/quantities by entering main data points. As a Buyer, it is your job to buy required materials for production warehouses to physically build products that have been ordered by customers. Enough material to keep production moving, but not too much in order to optimize warehouse space. Typically, this can easily be achieved through Excel.

This tool has brought that idea to fruition, and saves time and effort by providing a 6-month recommendation of when to order material! By plugging in the current inventory level, basic average usage, and how much a typical replenishment qty is, the javascript logic calculates and displays inventory levels per following month and recommendations.

After using this tool, I have enough insight to perform best course of action through seeing data diplayed and what the timiing looks like down the road.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations

Typically, I can use this web application at my desk, but I have also made this project web-responsive and accessible on my mobile device.  This allows me to be on the warehouse floor and verify what I am physically looking at.

## Lessons Learned:

I was able to reinforce DOM manipulation and OOP principals.  I organized the Javascript by utilizing a Class in order to have a clear and concise flow of code in the hopes that it would be easy to read for any other developer reading the JS file.
